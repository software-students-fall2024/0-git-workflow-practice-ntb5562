[interesting article](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/15/opinion/sunday/frank-bruni-how-to-survive-the-college-admissions-madness.html)

The title of the article is **"How to Survive the College Admissions Madness"**. I read it for a class. I found it very interesting. It talks about how people have a lot of pressure to get into pretigious colleges but college doesn't determine all of our future success. Some people who went to lesser known colleges ended up in the same career positions as the elite college ones. So future college students shouldn't base their identity on the college they go to.

Note: New commit after redoing github configuration.
