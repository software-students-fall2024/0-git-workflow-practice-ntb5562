[interesting article](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/15/opinion/sunday/frank-bruni-how-to-survive-the-college-admissions-madness.html)

The title of the article is **"How to Survive the College Admissions Madness"**. I read it for a class. It was very interesting because it talks about how people have a lot of pressure to get into pretigious colleges but college doesn't determine all of our future success. Some people who went to lesser known colleges ended up in the same career positions as the elite college ones. So future college students shouldn't base their identity on the college they go to.

### comment by Hannah LIANG: 
This article argues that while students and families often place immense importance on gaining acceptance to prestigious universities, attending an elite institution does not guarantee success. Bruni highlights that many individuals from less renowned colleges have achieved similar career outcomes as those from elite schools. I agree with what the article mentioned that the need to relieve the pressure and reminds students that their identity and future success are not solely determined by the college they attend.
